# Power, Inverse Power, Rayleigh, QR Hessenberg Decomposition Eigenvalues
The QR Hessenberg decomposition computes all the eigenvalues of the system of equations. The power method, the inverse power method, and the Rayleigh method compute the dominant eigenvalue of the linear system of equations AX = B. The matrix market format is used with A.dat and B.dat for the input files and C.dat for the output file. Compile with g++ -std=c++20 .
