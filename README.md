# Power, Inverse Power, Rayleigh, QR Decomposition Eigenvalues
The power iteration, the inverse power iteration, and the Rayleigh iteration algorithms compute the dominant eigenvalue of the linear system of equations AX = B. The QR Hessenberg decomposition computes all the eigenvalues of the linear system of equations.
